## Overview

This paper presents **Constitutive Quantum Field Theory (CQFT)**, a unified theoretical framework that provides the quantum field-theoretic foundation for **Constitutive Gravity Theory (CGT)**, introduced in Paper I. CQFT resolves three fundamental open questions of CGT by linking high-energy particle physics, modified gravity, and the quantum measurement problem through a single constitutive phase field, Φ.

The core achievements of this work are:

1.  **Origin of β:** The phenomenological coupling parameter β ≈ 8.3 × 10⁻⁵, responsible for explaining galactic rotation curves without dark matter, is derived as a consequence of spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking at the Grand Unification (GUT) scale, v ≈ 1.1 × 10¹⁷ GeV. The "Lock Formula" β = α_const (v/M_Pl)² connects Planck-scale physics to observed astrophysics.
2.  **Screening Mechanism:** The theory naturally evades stringent Solar System constraints on fifth forces through "constitutive screening." The effective coupling β_eff is exponentially suppressed (β_eff ∼ β e^(-r_β/ℓ)) in high-density environments like Earth, rendering deviations from General Relativity negligible at laboratory scales.
3.  **Constitutive Collapse Hypothesis (CCH):** The same field Φ that mediates modified gravity also induces objective wavefunction collapse. This unifies the explanation of galactic dynamics with a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The collapse rate Γ_collapse ∝ β²G²M²/ℏ³ is predicted to be negligible on Earth but significantly enhanced in deep space.

## Key Prediction

The most significant and falsifiable prediction of CQFT is **enhanced quantum decoherence in deep space**. For mesoscopic objects (mass ~ 10⁻¹⁵ kg, superposition size ~ 1 µm), the predicted collapse time in space is ~1 ms—orders of magnitude faster than terrestrial decoherence times and potentially detectable against the background of environmental noise.

This prediction provides a clear experimental pathway: **satellite-based matter-wave interferometry** with bacteria-scale particles is proposed as a definitive test. Detection of anomalous decoherence in orbit would constitute strong evidence for CQFT; non-detection would require its fundamental revision.

## Structure

*   **Section II:** Introduces the constitutive phase field Φ and its action, coupled to gravity and matter.
*   **Section III:** Derives the value of β from spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking at the GUT scale.
*   **Section IV:** Presents the Constitutive Collapse Hypothesis (CCH), derives the collapse rate formula, explains terrestrial screening, and details the space-based falsification test.
*   **Section V:** Discusses theoretical implications, contrasts CQFT with other models (e.g., Diósi-Penrose), outlines a comprehensive observational program for falsification, and proposes future research directions.

## Significance

CQFT represents a novel and coherent framework that spans 50 orders of magnitude in energy, from galactic astrophysics down to quantum laboratory physics. It proposes a single, fundamental field (Φ) as the origin of modified gravity, the suppression of fifth forces, and the quantum-to-classical transition, offering a potential path toward unifying gravity and quantum mechanics. The theory is explicitly designed to be testable, with satellite experiments providing a near-term opportunity for validation or refutation.

**Note:** This document is the second paper in a series. Paper I presents the phenomenological foundations of CGT. Papers III, IV, and V will explore cosmology, GUT unification, and a rigorous full quantum theory, respectively.
